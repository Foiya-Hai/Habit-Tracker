# About Habit Tracking
This repository is used for tracking daily habits. The daily tracking of habits and additional tasks improves planning, raises awareness and insight, guides daily actions, strengthens confidence and capability. 

Habits should be organized into logical and simple categories to improve ease of use and working memory. Each habit has a status, indicated by the color\* of the square icon to its left, and a short label that represents the individual habit. Each habit may be described within a habit-description file, but doing so is not necessary, as ease of personal use is prioritized. A daily habit-tracking-template file should be used to avoid unnecessary rework.

\*For color-blind accessibility, differently shaped or filled symbols can be used as an alternative in daily practice.

## Additional Task Details & Privacy
Beyond daily habit tasks, the details for additional tasks are kept private (marked by a []). This allows for personal privacy, while still allowing the number and status of tasks to be publicly visible, verifiably recorded, and analyzed for score tallying. The details for non-habit tasks are kept in a private repository for personal & professional reference. (https://github.com/Foiya-Hai/Work-Log)
